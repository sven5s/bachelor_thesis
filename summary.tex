The non relativistic quak model \cite{NRQM} was introduced and implemented with 
this thesis in \texttt{Sherpa} but not tested becau for the exicted \(\Lambda\) states 
 not so much experimental data exists. This model could be tested and verified.
An implementation of the form factor model from Lattice QCD \cite{Lattice_QCD} would be a great work. 
The Lattice QCD is a modern method of the QCD and used in many aspect. So 
the result from this form factor model would be very interesting.
