\section{Decay table}
\texttt{Sherpa} uses for the decays from all kinds of particles the decay channels 
and branching ratios from a decay table. Every particle has its own table. 
This table has to be updated manually with data from the Particle Data Group (PDG) because there 
exists no analytic calculations for the first principles. Also data from other 
sources are included, e.g. EvtGen. But a big amount of decay channel and 
branching ratios is taken from the PDG{\cite{lambda-pdg}}.\\
Newer measurements of particle decays are more accurate and so it is important 
to keep the decay table up to date. This will reduce the uncertainties for the 
branching ratios and so all kinds of results that are taken from a simulation.\\
A lot of changes were needed to update the decay table. An little abstract of 
the changes are visible below:
\begin{longtable}{| c | c | c |}
  \caption{Extract of the changes in the Decays.dat from the \(\Lambda_c^+\)}\label{ta:changes-decays}\\ 
  \hline
  \input{Decays.dat.changes}
\end{longtable}
The table above shows that the decay channel
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_c^+ \rightarrow P^+ + K_b \nonumber
\end{equation}
was replaced by
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_c^+ \rightarrow P^+ + K_s.  \nonumber
\end{equation}
The decay
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_c^+ \rightarrow P^+ + \pi^+ + \pi^- \nonumber
\end{equation}
was removed because the process is included in
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_c^+ \rightarrow P^+ + f(0980) \nonumber
\end{equation}
due to the decay of the f(0980):
\begin{equation}
  f(0980) \rightarrow \pi^+ + \pi^-. \nonumber
\end{equation}
The full list of changes can be found at {\ref{ta:changes-full}}.

The semileptonic decay of the \(\Lambda_c^+\) into a neutron is important for 
further considerations.
\begin{longtable}{| c | c |}
  \caption{Decays in a neutron in the Decays.dat from the \(\Lambda_c^+\)}\label{ta:ndecays}\\ 
  \hline
  \input{Decays.dat.neutron}
\end{longtable}
The branching ratios for these semileptonic decays are not taken from the PDG because
no actual experimental data exists. The reason is that 
most of the modern detectors can't detect neutrons very well. This comes from 
the neutral electric charge and the long lifetime of the neutron. An improved 
measurement would be recommended because this processes are important for 
the form factor calculation. The neutron is often considered as the final 
decay state of the \(\Lambda_c^+\).\\
All these changes leads to a sum of all branching ratios from \(87,98\%\). 
This is near to \(100\%\). But there are still missing some branching 
ratios.

\section{Another Form Factor parametrization}
The two formulas in {\eqref{eq:v-a}} show one popular parametrization for 
the V-A-Current another possible and popular writing is given in below:
\begin{align}
  \langle B(p', s') | V_\mu | \Lambda_c(p, s) \rangle & = \bar{u}(p', s') 
  \left( f^V_1(q^2) \gamma_\mu + f^V_2(q^2)i\sigma_{\mu\nu}\frac{q^\nu}{m_{\Lambda_c}} + 
  f^V_3(q^2)\frac{q_\mu}{m_{\Lambda_c}} \right) u(p, s) \nonumber \\
  \langle B(p', s') | A_\mu | \Lambda_c(p, s) \rangle & = \bar{u}(p', s') 
  \left( f^A_1(q^2) \gamma_\mu + f^A_2(q^2)\sigma_{\mu\nu}\frac{q^\nu}{m_{\Lambda_c}} + 
  f^A_3(q^2)\frac{q_\mu}{m_{\Lambda_c}} \right) \gamma^5 u(p, s). \label{eq:v-a-q}
\end{align}

In this notation \(q\) is \(p - p'\). A convsersion formula is now needed for the 
different parametrizations of the current. The equations in 
{\cite[Eq. 15]{form_factor_conversion}} give one direction for the transformation. 
But most of the following form factors are in the form with p and p' and not 
with q. So the inversion of the given transformation would be the easiest 
way to get a decent formula.  
The first step is to create a transformation matrix like below out of the 
formulas in {\cite[Eq. 15]{form_factor_conversion}}.
\begin{equation}
  \Spvek{f^V_1; f^V_2; f^V_3; f^A_1; f^A_2; f^A_3} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} + m_B }{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} & \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} + m_B }{2 m_B} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c} - m_B }{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} & - \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} - m_B }{2 m_B} \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B} \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot \Spvek{F_1; F_2; F_3; G_1; G_2; G_3} \label{eq:initmat}
\end{equation}
The block structure of the matrix is a mathemtaical manifestation of the 
independence of the vector and axial-vector part. This matrix can be splitted 
in two equations:
\begin{align}
  \Spvek{f^V_1; f^V_2; f^V_3} & =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} + m_B }{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} & \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} + m_B }{2 m_B} \\
    0 & -\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B} \\
    0 & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot \Spvek{F_1; F_2; F_3} \nonumber \text{ and }\\
  \Spvek{f^A_1; f^A_2; f^A_3} & =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c} - m_B }{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} & - \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} - m_B }{2 m_B} \\
    0 & -\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B} \\
    0 & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot \Spvek{G_1; G_2; G_3}. \label{eq:splitmat}
\end{align}
The matrices can be inverted if the determinant is unequal to zero. The 
determinant of both matrices are the same. This comes from the block 
structure with the zeroes in the first column. The value for the determinant is
\begin{equation}
  det (\dots) = \frac{m_{\Lambda_c}}{2 m_B}. \label{eq:det}
\end{equation}
If the mass of the \(\Lambda_c^+\) is nonzero than the matrices are invertible, which is 
obviously true. The matrix for \(G_i\) is similar to the matrix for \(F_i\). So it is 
enough to invert one matrix and compare with the other. The resulting matrices are:
\begin{align}
  \Spvek{F_1; F_2; F_3} & =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & \frac{3 m_{\Lambda_c} + m_B }{4 m_{\Lambda_c}} & -\frac{m_{\Lambda_c} + m_B }{4 m_B} \\
    0 & -1 & 1 \\
    0 & -\frac{m_B}{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} & -\frac{m_B}{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot \Spvek{f^V_1; f^V_2; f^V_3} \nonumber \text{ and }\\
  \Spvek{G_1; G_2; G_3} & =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & -\frac{3 m_{\Lambda_c} - m_B }{4 m_{\Lambda_c}} & \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} + m_B }{4 m_B} \\
    0 & -1 & 1 \\
    0 & -\frac{m_B}{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} & -\frac{m_B}{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \cdot \Spvek{f^A_1; f^A_2; f^A_3}. \label{eq:finmat}
\end{align}
And finally for every form factor a transformation formula can be obtained:
\begin{align}
  F_1 & = f^V_1 + \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} + m_B }{4} \left( \frac{3 f^V_2}{m_{\Lambda_c}} - \frac{f^V_3}{m_B} \right) \nonumber \\
  F_2 & = - f^V_2 + f^A_3 \nonumber \\
  F_3 & = - \frac{m_B}{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} \left(f^V_2 + f^V_3 \right) \nonumber \\
  G_1 & = f^A_1 + \frac{m_{\Lambda_c} - m_B }{4} \left( - \frac{3 f^V_2}{m_{\Lambda_c}} + \frac{f^V_3}{m_B} \right) \nonumber \\
  G_2 & = - f^A_2 + f^A_3 \nonumber \\
  G_3 & = - \frac{m_B}{2 m_{\Lambda_c}} \left(f^A_2 + f^V_3 \right). \label{eq:fintrans}
\end{align}
These transformation formulas have been added to \texttt{Sherpa}.

\section{Existing Form Factor implementation in \texttt{Sherpa}}
First it is important to know wich current parametrization is already used 
for baryon baryon transitions in \texttt{Sherpa}. With this information 
the right form factor parametrization can be choosen.
For a natural transition between two baryons the different coefficients 
are computed as:
\begin{align}
  c_{R1} & = V_1 - A_1 \nonumber \\
  c_{L1} & = -V_1 - A_1 \nonumber \\
  c_{R2} & = V_2 - A_2 \nonumber \\
  c_{L2} & = -V_2 - A_2 \nonumber \\
  c_{R3} & = V_3 - A_3 \nonumber \\
  c_{L3} & = -V_3 - A_3. \label{eq:c-coeff}
\end{align}
A natural transition means that the decayer and the daughter baryon have the same parity.
\(V_i\) and \(A_i\) comes from the choosen from factor model for the transition. 
They are other names for \(F_i\) and \(G_i\).
The current 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  V_\mu &= L_\mu(1, h_1, 0, h_0, c_{R1}, c_{L1}) + \\
        & \frac{p_{0, \mu}}{m_0} \cdot Y(1, h_1, 0, h_0, c_{R2}, c_{L2}) + \\
        & \frac{p_{1, \mu}}{m_1} \cdot Y(1, h_1, 0, h_0, c_{R3}, c_{L3}) \label{eq:b-curr}
\end{split}
\end{align}
is sumed over all possible helicities from the decaying \(h_0\) and the daughter baryon \(h_1\).
The definition of \(L_\mu\) is given in \cite[Eq. A.96]{diploma} and the Y in 
\cite[Eq. A.94]{diploma}. These are internal functions of \texttt{Sherpa}. 
They are defined as
\begin{align}
  L_\mu(1, h_1, 0, h_0, c_{R1}, c_{L1}) & = \bar{u}(p_1, h_1)\gamma_\mu \left( c_{R1} P_R + c_{L1} P_L \right) u(p_0, h_0) \nonumber \\
  Y(1, h_1, 0, h_0, c_{R2}, c_{L2}) & = \bar{u}(p_1, h_1) \left( c_{R2} P_R + c_{L2} P_L \right) u(p_0, h_0) \nonumber \\
  Y(1, h_1, 0, h_0, c_{R3}, c_{L3}) & = \bar{u}(p_1, h_1) \left( c_{R3} P_R + c_{L3} P_L \right) u(p_0, h_0). \label{eq:LY}
\end{align}
The projection operators that are used in {\eqref{eq:LY}} are defined as
\begin{align}
  P_R = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \gamma_5 \right) \nonumber \text{ and }\\
  P_L = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \gamma_5 \right). \label{eq:proj}
\end{align}
This all equations together form a current wich is similar to {\eqref{eq:v-a}}.
This can also easily been seen through the signs of the \(\gamma_5\) and the 
signs of the \(c_R\) and \(c_L\).
All other current parametrization have to be converted to observe the 
existing behavior.

\section{Form Factor Models}
\subsection{Covariant Confined Quark Model (CCQM)}
The idea behind the covariant confined quark model 
({\cite{CCQM_N}}, {\cite{CCQM_L}}) is to use two loops 
Feynman diagrams with free quark propagators. This model was developed for mesons but 
is extended to baryons. It is also possible to successfully calculate tetraquark 
states with this theory.\\
For the transition to \(\Lambda + l^+ + \nu_l\) the elaboration{\cite{CCQM_L}} was 
considered and for \(n + l^+ + \nu_l\) the elaboration{\cite{CCQM_N}}.
The parametrization of the form factor is given by
\begin{equation}
  f(q^2) = \frac{F(0)}{1 - a s + b s^2} \text{ with } s = \frac{q^2}{m_{\Lambda_c}} \label{eq:ccqmff}.
\end{equation}
The parameters F(0), a and b are taken from the numerical results of {\cite{CCQM_L}}.

\subsection{Non relativistic Quark Model (NRQM)}
Baryons with a heavy quark possesses a special symmetry. This symmetry is 
called heavy quark symmetry. The main impact to the characteristics of the baryon results from the degrees of freedom of the 
light quarks and are independent from the degrees of freedom of the heavy quark. {\cite{NRQM}}\\
This form factor model can be used to calculate transistions to excited \(\Lambda\)
baryons {\cite{NRQM}}. The parametrization of the form factors a more complicated compared 
to the other ones:
\begin{align}
  F &= \left(a_0 + a_2 q^2 + a_4 q_4\right) e^{- \frac{3 m_\sigma^2 p_\Lambda^2}
  {2 m_\Lambda^2 \alpha_{\lambda \lambda'}^2} } \nonumber\\
  p_\Lambda & = \frac{1}{2 m_\Lambda}  \lambda^\frac{1}{2}(m_{\Lambda_c}^2, m_\Lambda^2, q^2) \nonumber \\
  \lambda(x, y, z) & = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx \text{ (triangle function)} \nonumber \\
  \alpha_{\lambda \lambda'} & = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_\lambda^2 + \alpha_{\lambda'}^2 }{2}}, \label{eq:nrqmff}
\end{align}
where \(m_\sigma\) is the mass of the light quark obtained from 
{\cite[p. 13/I]{NRQM}} and the \(\alpha_\lambda\) are size parameters of 
the baryons from {\cite[p. 13/II]{NRQM}}.

\subsection{Light-Cone Sume Rule (LCSR)}
The light-cone sum rule is a very famous technique in the class of QCD sum 
rules{\cite{LCSR}}. The basic idea is that the vacuum condensates carry no momentum. 
The light-cone expansion is used with increasing twist. The transition from 
\(\Lambda_c^+\) into \(\Lambda + l^+ + \nu_l\) is computed with this model in
{\cite{LCSR}}.\\
The parametrization is very simple due to  the same values for the 
first two axial-vector and vector form factors:
\begin{align}
  f^V_1 & = f^A_1 \nonumber \\
  f^V_2 & = f^A_2 \nonumber \\
  f_i(q^2) & = \frac{f_i(0)}{a_2 s^2 + a_1 s + 1 } \text{ with } s = \frac{q^2}{m_{\Lambda_c}}. \label{eq:lcsrff}
\end{align}
\(f_i(0)\), \(a_2\) and \(a_1\) are parameters of this parametrization. Only the 
first two form factors are nonzero.

\subsection{Relativistic Quark Model (RQM)}
The relativistic quark model{\cite{RQM}} is based on the diquark wave function 
and the baryon wave function of the bound quark-diquark state. The calculation 
were done with a relativistic quasipotential equation of the Schr\"{o}dinger type.
All computation were relativistically done.\\
It can predict semileptonic transitions into a neutron as well as into \(\Lambda\).
The parametrization{\eqref{eq:rqmff}} was done until a very high order of the 
\(q^2\).
\begin{equation}
  F(q^2) = \frac{F(0)}{1 - \sigma_1 s + \sigma_2 s^2 + \sigma31 s^3 + \sigma_4 s^4} 
  \text{ with } s = \frac{q^2}{m_{\Lambda_c}} \label{eq:rqmff}
\end{equation}

\subsection{QCD Sum Rule (QCDSR)}
Nonperturbative aspects are used in this sum rule {\cite{QCDSR}}. The approach of 
the QCD sum rule is the expansion in local operators. \(\Lambda + l^+ + \nu_l\) 
is considered in the article.\\
In this Model two different parametrizations exists. The pole parametrization 
{\eqref{eq:qcdsrff-pp}} is used like in the other models. But this pole 
parametrization is a lot simpler due to the relations between the form factors.
\begin{align}
  f^A_1 & = - f^V_1 \nonumber \\
  f^A_2 & = f^V_2 \nonumber \\
  f^V_i(q^2) & = \frac{a_0}{a_1 - q^2} \label{eq:qcdsrff-pp}
\end{align} 
The other form of the parametrization {\eqref{eq:qcdsrff}} is more complicated 
but interesting due to the exponential ansatz.
\begin{align}
  f^A_1 & = - f^V_1 \nonumber \\
  f^A_2 & = - f^V_2 \nonumber \\
  f^V_1(q^2) & = e^{\frac{q^2 - a_1}{a_0}} \nonumber \\
  f^V_2(q^2) & = \frac{a_0}{a_1 - q^2} \label{eq:qcdsrff}
\end{align} 
The third form factor is zero in both cases.
